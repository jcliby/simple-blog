# Simple Blog App

This app was build using React and React Router. This application was built as a project for Udacity's front end developer program.

This project was an exercise in HTML and CSS styling. Used React for no reason other than wanting to continue familiarizing myself with the library.

## Requirements

Node.js is required to run this application. Please consult [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) or [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to set up Node.js on your machine.

### Setup and Install

Clone project into an empty directory

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jcliby/simple-blog.git
```

Move to project directory and install

```
$ cd reactnd-project-myreads-starter
$ npm install
```

### Start

```
$ npm start
```

### Note

Because this project was mainly an exercise in design and styling React-Router functionality has not been fully implemented. Navigation via URL has not been set up.
